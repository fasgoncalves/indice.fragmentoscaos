  <!-- 3) EXCERTO -->
  <div style="border-left:4px solid #ffcc66;padding:10px 12px;margin:8px 0 16px 0;background:rgba(255,204,102,0.06);border-radius:10px;">
    <p style="margin:0;font-style:italic;color:#ffe2a8;">
      In a country planted by the sea, power and profit often share the same dance floor.
      The scandal is not the dance itself—only how calmly the orchestra keeps playing.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- 4) CORPO -->
  <h3 style="color:#ffcc66 !important;margin:18px 0 6px 0;">
    <span style="color:#ffcc66 !important;">The Man of Two Hats (and Many Shadows)</span>
  </h3>

  <p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;">
    Picture the ordinary citizen, if you please: waking up, walking to a single job, paying taxes with the resigned dignity of those who know the bill always arrives.
    No offshore mirages. No corporate labyrinth. No real-estate ghosts that appear only on paper.
  </p>

  <p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;">
    Now picture the Deputy-Entrepreneur: he rises, slips into the tailored costume of “public servant”, and speaks of fiscal virtue with the solemnity of a cathedral.
    Then—blink—he swaps the parliamentary badge for a boardroom briefcase and goes to meet clients inside a luxury development where the air smells of polished marble and plausible deniability.
    Everything legal. Everything “transparent”. Everything… convenient.
  </p>

  <p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;">
    Being a deputy is not like being a baker or a doorman. In theory, it demands a single north: the public interest.
    But in Portugal, “exclusivity” has become an elastic word—stretched like cheap cotton until the fabric confesses its holes.
  </p>

  <h3 style="color:#ffcc66 !important;margin:18px 0 6px 0;">
    <span style="color:#ffcc66 !important;">The Investigation: Suspense Without Surprise</span>
  </h3>

  <p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;">
    The Prosecutor investigated. Rumours gathered like storm clouds. Headlines did their evening gymnastics.
    Would this be the moment a major name finally fell? A conviction? A sentence? A real ending?
  </p>

  <p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;">
    No, reader. In Portugal, certain proceedings feel scripted by someone who adores plot twists yet fears conclusions—
    happy or tragic, depending on who’s watching.
  </p>

  <p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;">
    The case was <strong>filed away</strong>.
    A magic phrase. It sounds like: “nothing to see”, “move along”, “a misunderstanding”.
    And thus the Deputy-Entrepreneur releases a sigh—not of relief, but of contained victory:
    “Justice proved my honour,” he declares, as if procedural shelving were a doctorate in moral purity.
  </p>

  <p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;">
    Between what is legally punishable and what is ethically indecent, there lies an ocean—
    and in that ocean, many learn to swim like champions.
  </p>

  <h3 style="color:#ffcc66 !important;margin:18px 0 6px 0;">
    <span style="color:#ffcc66 !important;">The Drawer: Not a Conclusion, but a Tool</span>
  </h3>

  <p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;">
    To file is not to erase. To file is to store.
    And what is stored can be reopened—if not in court, then in the political arena, where memory is weapon and fog is strategy.
    The opponent will say: “He was investigated!”
    He will reply: “It was filed!”
    And the voter stands between them, watching a ping-pong match in which the ball is their own trust.
  </p>

  <p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;">
    Meanwhile, the Deputy’s company moves forward like a ship with favourable winds.
    Deals prosper. Applause travels across the chamber.
    And Portugal—old country of soft habits—keeps accepting that its representatives may be, at once,
    lawmakers and lobbyists of themselves.
  </p>

  <h3 style="color:#ffcc66 !important;margin:18px 0 6px 0;">
    <span style="color:#ffcc66 !important;">The Moral (if there is one)</span>
  </h3>

  <p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;">
    In a land where conflicts of interest are treated as “professional coincidences,” this is not an exception.
    It is the rule made flesh, suit, and tie.
    It shocks not because it is rare—
    but because it reveals how normal it has become for power and business to waltz in the same ballroom,
    to music only a few are paid to hear.
  </p>

  <p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;">
    And so we close as we began, with iron in the ink:
    In a country planted by the sea, planting companies while writing laws is not vice.
    It is virtuosity.
    And whoever disagrees may file the complaint—preferably in the same drawer.
  </p>

  <!-- 5) EPÍLOGO -->
  <h3 style="color:#ffcc66 !important;margin:18px 0 6px 0;">
    <span style="color:#ffcc66 !important;">Epilogue</span>
  </h3>

  <p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;">
    Next time you hear a deputy speak of “transparency” or “ethics,” remember:
    beneath the shirt may live a bespoke business suit—measured, pressed, and perfectly compatible with speeches.
  </p>

  <p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;">
    And the law—an elderly lady with distracted eyes—sees nothing wrong with it.
  </p>

  <p style="margin:0 0 14px 0;">
    Until the next investigation. Or the next filing.
    Whatever best serves the plot.
  </p>

  <p style="margin:0 0 14px 0;">
    Parallel reading suggested: <strong>“The Prince”</strong>, by Machiavelli.
    And <strong>“How to Manage an Empire Without Letting Go of the Family Business”</strong>—Portuguese edition—
    available (almost) everywhere.
