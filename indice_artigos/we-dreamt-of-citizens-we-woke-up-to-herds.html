<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>In the mid-1970s, at the age of 15, and amidst a rebellious and informed youth, I dreamed — and saw the world changing every day. And in my eyes shone the light of someone who truly believed.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

<p><em>Utopia?</em>, you might say.<br>Yes, perhaps a little. But I was no longer that innocent — I had read <em>Utopia</em> by Thomas More, and many other utopias sold as heavens on earth, and much more about the world and humanity.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>Yet, even so, just as I witnessed the immense progress of 20th-century science, I believed in a new world and in the continuous evolution of humankind.<br>In a time when knowledge would illuminate the people.<br>In democracies blooming like gardens of liberty.<br>In citizens taking their destiny into their own hands — free, enlightened, and dignified.<br>Without dogmas, without tyrannies, and free to think and to change, to create, to build a future of dignity for all.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>That was the promise of the future.<br>And I, like so many others, believed in it with every fiber of my being.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

<p><strong>More than fifty years have passed.</strong><br>Today I look around… and I see, with deep sorrow:<br><strong>we were wrong. Utterly. Tragically.</strong></p>

<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p><!-- wp:separator --></p>

<p>What I see are not upright citizens.<br>I see masses who are educated… <strong>but not thoughtful</strong>.<br>Graduates who never read beyond the required textbooks. PhDs without ethics, without critical sense, without a single drop of civic awareness.<br>People who spent years in schools and universities <strong>without ever having passed through the fire of reflection</strong>.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:separator --></p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They are outraged by surface trends, swept up by the noise of the herd.<br>They march for infantile narratives, for hollow slogans, for causes packaged for quick consumption.<br>And in the face of the rot of power, the plunder of the public purse, the organized corruption… <strong>not even a grimace. Not a word. Not a gesture.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></blockquote>

<p><!-- /wp:quote --></p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>Where is the awareness we were promised?<br>Where are the fruits of mass education, of the internet, of globalization?<br><strong>What use are all these degrees if the spirit remains domesticated?</strong></p>

<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>The truth, however harsh, is that <strong>humanity has not evolved — it has regressed</strong>.<br>It has retreated in thought, in character, in courage.<br>We are losing what we had conquered at the end of the 20th century.<br>Western civilization — once a beacon of free thought — is being corroded from within, anesthetized by comfort and distraction, infiltrated by forces that despise everything that made it possible.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Perhaps it really is time to stop.</h3>

<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>To be silent.<br>To think with brutal seriousness.<br>And maybe…<br>To go back.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>Not to the chains of history, but to the point when thought was a seed, not an algorithm.<br>To a time when school shaped restless minds, not obedient professionals.<br>To when being a citizen was a noble duty — not a bureaucratic formality of voting and returning to the couch.</p>

<p><strong>Because the greatest disappointment is not what they’ve done to the world.</strong><br>It’s what <strong>the people themselves have allowed to be done.</strong></p>
